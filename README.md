# Run - automation script in Bash

Quite good replecement for Makefile (example [here](https://github.com/thevops/makefile-automation))

Look at example file `run` in this repository.

Here is YouTube video with more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdmYd5hJISM

## Fast start

1. Download `run` file
2. Put `alias run='./run'` to your `.zshrc`
3. Execute `source <(./run zsh_setup)` for auto-completion.
